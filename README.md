Intro Repository

What is a branch?
A branch is a location in which it is appropriate to try out new ideas within your existing work without actually affecting the primary piece of work. This is a sort of “workplace” for experimenting with changes and  thoughts that will not have any impact on the group project until another member reviews the work and approves.

What is a commit?
A commit is play-by-play account of the changes within your file, tracking your work and allowing others to see exactly what you have done and its impact upon the branch as a whole. Commits work as an ordered account of everything you have done, allowing you to go back to any one specific point.

What is the purpose of a pull request?
A pull request acts to create dialogue among peers, allowing enhanced collaboration and transparency to best fix a given problem.
